## What the site is

The company website for three fire rescue services in the Front Range.

## What I did

Quite a bit of the site content and development actually. This was one of the first projects that I was able to do a lot of the work alone for Variant Studios. The designer gave me photoshop files that essentially look like what you see today and I was tasked with building out the structure of the site in Jekyll.
