## What the site is

An open source project for housing the New Zealand Sign Language dictionary.

## What I did

Since this is an ongoing open source project, I was able to take some of the newer requested features. My main contribution has been adding the ability to add vocab list items from the search. I worked with a team from Ackama including design resources to do a large body of work surrounding the vocab features.
