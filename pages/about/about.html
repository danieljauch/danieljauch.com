        <p>I'm a standard nerd.</p>
        <p>I love video games, tabletop games, roleplaying games, web development, and esoterica.</p>
        <p>More seriously, though...</p>
        <h4>My Ethos</h4>
        <p>I believe in ethical programming.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open source</li>
          <li>Customer advocating</li>
          <li>Security and performance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I believe in personal development.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Always learning</li>
          <li>Keeping up with trends and adapting new technologies as they gain relevance</li>
          <li>Leaving each project having implemented something new so skills are always increasing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My goal in work is to make something that's important, makes a difference, and I feel good about working on.</p>
        <p>I strive to be fun to work with, constructive in all feedback, and someone you want to have in a team.</p>

        <p>React front end</p>
        <p>Rails back end</p>
        <p>I have a special place in my heart for anything Ruby as I learned on Python first. For front end, I'm very open to using different and new frameworks, and React is where my experience is.</p>
