I've started doing something for the last few months now where I spend the first working day of each month with my entire computer in grayscale.

## Why?

For a long time, I've understood vision-empairment in abstract terms. Something like a AA rating on [WCAG's contrast checker](https://contrastchecker.com/) or a "pass" on [W3C's validator](https://validator.w3.org/), but what do those things _really_ mean?

## What have you learned?

### 1. Some of the best apps for contrast are developer apps

You know those awful eyesore websites with blank backgrounds and super bright text? To be honest, they were a bit of relief in comparison to something like BitBucket where there is a blend of varieties of gray.

### 2. Every color has a brightness that is hard to notice in color
